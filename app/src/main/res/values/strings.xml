2.       Usage steps:\n
a)       After connecting your mobile to the device through Bluetooth, the data will be displayed on your BPL iOxy Application
        screen.\n
b)      After the connection, real time data of “Blood Oxygen (SPO2)”, “Pulse Rate (PR)” and “Perfusion Index (PI)”
        will be displayed.\n
c)       The application will record the monitoring results and displays with time range on your mobile phone.\n
d)	To start a measurement, Tap on the “START RECORDING” button.
Note: Ensure that at least 40 seconds has elapsed before you press on STOP RECORDING” for a record to get saved. \n
e) 	To save this measurement, Tap on the “STOP RECORDING” button.
        The App shall generate a record which includes “report” and “trend chart”.\n
Note: Multiple Users can monitor and save measurements using dedicated logins.
        Verify your user profile before taking measurements.\n\n
3.       Application use:\n
With the help of this App, the real time results can be synchronised with the device and shown on the
        smart phone for a better user experience. Using the smartphone, the user information can be edited and
        reports can be reviewed at any point of time.\n
User Info: To Edit user’s name, age, height, and weight. New Users can be added at any point of time.\n
User Guide: For App usage assistance\n\n
4.       Health Parameters measured:\n
a)       Oxy-haemoglobin Saturation: Oxygen Saturation (SPO2) is a term which refers to the concentration of oxygen
        in the blood. It measures the percentage of haemoglobin binding sites in the blood stream occupied by Oxygen,
        which is a very important physiological parameter of respiration cycle. The normal range of blood oxygen
        levels is considered to be 95-100 percent. Between 90-95 percent, the blood oxygen level is considered to be
        low but it does not necessarily indicate any health issue.\n
b)      Pulse Rate: Pulse, also known as heart rate is the number of times the heart beats per minute.
        Normally, pulse rate and heart rate are identical. The Pulse rate range for a healthy person would be 60-90
        bpm. Nervousness and an excited state of being may increase the pulse rate/heart rate.\n
c)       Perfusion Index: Perfusion index or PI is the ratio of the pulsatile blood flow to the non-pulsatile
        static blood flow in a peripheral tissue, such as fingertip, toe, or ear lobe. Perfusion Index is an
        indication of pulse strength at the sensor site. The PI value ranges from 0.02 percent for a very weak pulse
        to 20 percent for a very strong pulse. The Pi value varies depending on the users, physiological conditions,
        and monitoring sites. For a healthy user, the value of PI would be greater than three percent.\n\n
5.       About this software:\n
BPL Be Well app is designed and developed by BPL Medical Technologies Pvt. Ltd for the device BPL iOxy. This application is compatible with mobile phones with the operating system Android 4.3 (Or above).\n

        <b>Converting Weight Units</b>\n\n
The factory default unit is kg. For unit conversion, open the
battery cover at the back when power-off and adjust the gear
toggle switch. The units available are kg and lb  from
left to right. When the switch is placed at one of the gears, the
displayed unit automatically switches to the corresponding
weight unit after the scale is turned on.\n\n
        The unit conversion toggle switch is located inside the battery
case at the back of the scale.

    <string name="bio_user_guide">

       <b>Preparation before measurement</b>\n\n


(1)	Keep your body and mood calm, take off the thicker clothes such as coat,
 sweater, Etc. When measuring, bare upper arm or wear thinner shirt.\n

(2)	Users, who use APP software, need to open the Bluetooth of the device and terminal,
 open the APP software, and connect with the device.\n\n


When a call comes in during the measurement, the measurement will be terminated.
It is recommended that Android  device be set in airplane mode during measurement to avoid strong magnetism interference.



•	Using Steps\n
•	Apply the cuff\n


1.	Loosen the calibre of the curly cuff slightly. Place a bare arm through the cuff directly according to
 the instruction\n

2.	Position the cuff 1-2cm above the elbow joint and ensure the mark  on the cuff shall lie above artery.\n


3.	Pull one end of the cuff to the lateral and tighten. The cuff should fit comfortably, yet snugly
        around your arm. You should be able to insert one finger between your arm and the cuff.\n\n


Body posture\n\n


  Stay still and calm for five minutes before taking a blood pressure measurement.
  Be seated with your feet flat on the floor without crossing your legs.
  Place your hand palm-side up in front of you on a flat surface such as a desk or table.
  The cuff should be placed at the same level as your heart.\n\n

	<b>NOTE : </b>\n\n

	Incorrect measuring posture showed as follows might cause an incorrect measurement:\n
	Bent over（lean forward）;\n
	Sitting cross-legged;\n
	Bend the body because of the low table or sitting on sofa.\n\n



•	Measuring\n

•	Short press (press and hold it less than 2s) the power button to turn on the device, then the cuff pressure
        automatically and the screen shows rising pressure values. Stay still and calm during measurement.
        Do not move your arm, body and the device.\n\n

•	You can press the select users button “   ” to select user.
        If you need to change the user during measurement, short press (press and hold it less than 2s)
        the power button to stop the measurement. Then press the button “   ” to select user. Short press
        (press and hold it less than 2s) the power button again to continue the measurement.\n\n
•	Display the measurement value\n

•	The device exhausts automatically and displays the measurement results.
        About the display interface of measurement results, please refer to chapter “Display ”.\n\n

•	Users, who use the APP software, can read the measurement results on the software interface.\n

•	Take off the cuff\n
•	Turn off the device\n

•	Long press (press and hold it more than 2s) the power button to turn off the device after the measurement.\n\n

•	<b>NOTE :</b>\n\n

   While measuring blood pressure, the users must stay still and calm without any talk;
  The cuff tied on the limb shall be on the same level as the patient’s
  heart so as to avoid the reading error resulting from the hydrostatics effect of the blood
  flow between the heart and cuff. If the cuff position is higher than heart level, the BP reading will be
  lower, the measured result shall be added 0.75mmHg\n\n

   (0.1kPa) for each centimeter higher; in case the cuff position is lower than heart level,
   the BP reading will be higher, the measured result shall be deducted 0.75mmHg (0.1kPa) for each centimeter lower;
   If the signal measurement time is more than two minutes and the device doesn’t exhaust automatically,
    please take off the cuff and turn off the device.\n\n



   You can stop the measurement process at any time by pressing “Start/Stop” button.\n\n




  Prolonged and frequent BPL BT02 measurements are associated with ischemia and neuropathy
  in the limb wearing the cuff. Please examine the extremities of the limb frequently for normal color, warmth and
  sensitivity. If any abnormality is observed, stop the BPL BT02 measurements.\n

  Too frequent measurements may have influence on the measurement results.\n\n
